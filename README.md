## Why Lua

- Simple - Reading a small lua script with clear names is a lot more intuitive
  than trying to understand a JSON file.
- Conditionals - Adding branches to your dotfiles based on host, OS, installed
  programs, is super easy, because Lua is _just another programming language_
- Easily extensible - Adding your own modules, helpers etc. is super easy
- Fast - LuaJit is very very very fast.
- Small - LuaJit is absolutely tiny, and can fit onto most any system.
- Portable - Since LuaJit can be built on basically any platform
